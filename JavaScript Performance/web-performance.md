# Web Performance

## Requirements

- You need to have [the latest version of Node](http://nodejs.org). Preferably, you're using 9.8.0, but the latest LTS _should_ work as well.
- You should have `npx` installed using `npm install -g npx`.
- Install the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).

## Repositories

We'll be using these repositories during the workshop. Make sure you `git pull` and `npm install` again before the workshop kicks off. Steve will also be positing his code to the `live-coding` branch of each during the workshop.
